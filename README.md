# TextBasedBrowser
This is my take on the "Text based browser" project on HyperSkill. It's not really a browser. It just kinda looks like one.

It renders linked text as blue, but the links aren't links. It has a back function that pulls content from a history file. But, a real browser would be reloading from the source; not recalling saved data. Lynx it's not. ;-)
